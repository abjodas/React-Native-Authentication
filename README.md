React Native Authentication Flow with AWS Amplify
This project is made with React Native CLI with authentication kept in mind. This app has been built from scratch and offers an understanding on how an authentication
flow is done properly in React Native. I have used AWS Amplify and AWS Cognito to manage the backend authentication. The following code can be used by anyone 
looking to build an authentication flow in their app and wants a starting point.
